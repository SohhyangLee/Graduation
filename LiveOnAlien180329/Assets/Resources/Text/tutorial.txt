Hello? Is anyone there?
OH! Nice to meet you. I am an Alien from the outside of the Earth!
How did I come here?
As usual I was walking the universe,
Some delicious smell led me!
I ran after the smell without even knowing gravity was pulling.
So I fell down to the Earth.
When I woke up, my spaceship had been broken.
But! The Earth has many smells that lead me!
So I decided to be the king of COOKING!!!
Will you join my adventure?
If you say YES, I will invite you to my home! (Click the home in the map)
